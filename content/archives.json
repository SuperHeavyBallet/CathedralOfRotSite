        "title": "On The Superiority of Dwarvs",
        "content": [
            "In this entry into the Grand Compendium of Dwarven Superiority Vol III, I will explain and support through scientific methods why exactly the Dwarv Organism is naturally superior to all other offshoots of Dwarg type creatures.",
            "First, we shall start with the names. It is apparent that there is a single character difference between the name Dwarv and Dwarf (Dorf is not included, because that is not a real word nor name). ",
            "Clearly, the “V” and the “f” characters mark the drastic difference between the types of creatures. The “V” is a character directly traceable back to Dwarg cave runes. (You can see that the Dwarv and the Cave both clearly share that character as much as they share heritage). With this simple fact, it is evident that the Dwarv alone is the direct descendant of the older people, while the Dwarf, lacking the “V” is in fact not.",
            "Conversely, the Dwarf (and Dorf) were not blessed by this ancient lineage. Instead their names are formed with crude, likely Goblin rooted guttural utterings. I speak of course, of the “f” character. Note that I use the inferior version, not the superior “F”, as even though that larger character is superior, it is still not a V, and never actually features in the Dwarf name, so implicitly even there, the Dwarf is by necessity, an inferior creature.",
            "Furthermore, it is evident that the letter “f”, being a more primal, goblin-esque character, visually represents its own status. The “f” is, if continued at its root, very close in shape to the “s” character but stretched, attempting to hide its origins, which you will all agree is the character with which the snake is implicitly represented. This suggests that the “f” represents a snake, but cut in half, to indicate that it should be eradicated and not allowed to persist. Moreover, whoever crafted this half snake letter, felt it needed further reinforcing as a letter not to be allowed, by adding the crossbar through the already severed snake, to indicate it as a forbidden entity.",
            "And, following from this knowledge, it should be noted that the nature of the language used by the Dwarf creatures shares such degenerated form as their own title. They have words of their own - used frequently - such as “fumble”, “failure, “filth”... words that they require to accurately describe their everyday activities. And as you’ll know, words such as these do not exist naturally in the Dwarv lexicon of terms. This will stand - I’m sure you’ll agree - as further proof of the inferior nature of the Dwarfs.",
            "With these facts, it is quite clear how the original Dwargs and older mountain folk felt that creatures like the Dwarfs should sit in the hierarchy of beings below the mountain.",
            "Finally, as is well known, Dwarvs are genetically the tallest of the bunch, with the Dwarfs appearing childlike even to our own children. Of course, the status of the Dorfs needs barely considering.",
            "It is heavily suggested that, if a citizen of the Dwarv tribe finds themselves to be under the expected height threshold of the Dwarv tribe, he or she should first consider if they are actually a Dwarv and not in fact an absent minded Dwarf who forgot their place in the world, because it is naturally impossible that a Dwarv should be shorter than even the tallest Dwarf, only by spiteful Dwarf spells can this ever happen.",
            "If then, it is determined that the (temporarily) less than optimal Dwarv is sub par in verticality, he or she - being the more intelligent type - should immediately seek out the closest Foot Maester, and whisper to him of your need for greater status. He will understand right away, and produce the appropriate charms to counter this malicious spell cast upon you, which should be placed beneath your heels to elevate your sensitive parts from the cursed ground beneath you. It may be so that you require multiple charms to sufficiently elevate you above the curse.",
            "Unfortunately, if the situation arises that you find yourself in need of more than 5 charms per foot, then the spell cast is too great, likely bolstered by goblin whispers. In this case you will be expelled from the tribe and sent to the pits, for fear that the spell may spread, or worse, the Dwarfs will learn of our spell evasion measures, and seek further, more devious tactics to undermine our superiority.",
            "In conclusion, I hope you will see and agree that by scientific and natural methods, the Dwarv tribe has proven to be the superior type in comparison to the Dwarfs, and of course the Dorfs.",
            "There are many other attributes and reasons why this is true, but name and vertical status are among the most obvious, although it may be challenging to convey even this to a Dwarf, so superiority and inferiority are generally just assumed and exuded, so that they understand their place beneath us. (Although they lack the greater intelligence of the Dwarv, so it remains possible that they remain blissfully unaware of their status, so if one finds the opportunity, it is suggested that they remind the Dwarfs of this.)"

            "A quiet shout, A whispered yell, The master hears, And all is well.",
            "- A Common Rock Hugger Chant",
            "The Rock Huggers are a small village of oddly intelligent creatures, some grotesque mix of Goblin and Dwarf blood. By all normal standards, they seem to be vile, twisted parodies of life that really have no place existing, yet they persist. Many attempts have been made to extinguish their blight on existence, but they scurry away each time into endless networks of hidden tunnels and holes bored into the mountain walls that surround their cave.",
            "Their chief problem is that they endlessly worship the Rotten Stone, forever chanting and calling out to it, with their twisting whispers echoing down corridors of rock and shadows, often trickling out into other societies elsewhere in the mountain. This is the time that most of those societies will organise cleansing marches through the depths, realising that they cannot extinguish the Rock Huggers properly, but they can at least hold off their summoning chant, for it is well known what will happen if the Rotten Stone hears their corrupted calls.",
            "The Rock Huggers are perhaps not intelligent per se. They are ritualistic and barbarously cunning. They worship the Rotting Stone and the decay it promises well enough. However, they are unaware that as they chant their merry little tunes, the sharp rocks of their endless tunnels warp their brutish sounds into an unintelligible mountain language, which then gains the ability to pierce through rock and summon even more terrible creatures to crawl out through the shadows and drag any living thing below into the dark.",
            "Another species exists; The Mountain Moles, as other groups have named them. You see, the Mountain Moles are, in a word; mysterious. Essentially everybody acknowledges that they do exist to some extent, and some have even claimed to have witnessed their existence. However, very little is known about them. Only that they seem to be small, wrapped in robes and slick fur, with endlessly hooded faces.",
            "But regardless of the specifics of their existence, it is well known that they control the mountain, as much as many other groups would like to present themselves as kings or such. The Mountain Moles can find their way to and from any place in the mountain without error. Leaving no sound nor trace, except for small piles of rubble from where they have burrowed, carving deep and furiously through the sheer rock face of any wall. Some say they chew through the rock, others believe they have tongues that can whisper to the walls, commanding them to part.",
            "It has become known (although how is unknown), that the Mountain Moles have grown displeased by the corrupted whispers the Rock Huggers have been uttering. It is hoped that those mysterious creatures will intervene and hopefully put an end to the childish mischief those wretched creatures persistently bring upon all other mountain inhabitants.",
            "There is however, an alternative thought - only existing within certain communities - that the Mountain Moles will not help in this regard, because it is believed that those terrible creatures summoned from the shadows by warped whispers are in fact the Mountain Moles themselves, blindly guided by those twisted tones the rocks echo out to them. The hope however, is that this is not inline with the beliefs of the Mountain Moles, and that they will put an end to that corruption.",
            "Whichever way the rocks tumble, they will tumble - probably onto somebody, ideally for most - onto the Rock Huggers, as the Mountain Moles are suspected to be the only creatures fit to deal with those awful things, and able to fit into their cramped tunnels."

        "content": [
            "Ruffin was approximately 5 minutes away from drawing his last breath, and perhaps it would be the last breath drawn by a dorf ever again. The future of his kind depended on this journey into the underchasm, where darkness swirled and madness flew through shadows, in search of lost travelers to swoop upon.",
            "Ruffin had entered through the Green Gate, the entry point least often used, but charted by most attempts at mapping as the closest gate to The Rotting Stone, as the stench would be most strongly smelt from the safer side of that gate, enough that many investigators had perished simply from proximity without ever passing through.",
            "But something had gone terribly wrong. The stench had spread, while all gates remained sealed and barricaded, the entire community of dorfs huddling inside the cave network began to gasp and wheeze in ways only seen by those investigators who fled back through the gate. Somehow, the rotten stench had spread beyond the stone’s lawful domain.",
            "And so, Ruffin had been volunteered to go beyond the gate, to see if something could be done to appease that restless Rotting Stone.",
            "But now, he found himself entirely lost and alone, stumbling through the dark with distant shrieks echoing through the air above him. He could feel cold, sharp rocks bite into his palm, and so he used their pain as guidance towards their master. Somewhere ahead, that awful monument to nature pierced through the rocks, spreading its horrible disease from sources deeper even than this mountain’s roots.",
            "His head spun as his feet stumbled and rolled across unsettled stones. At any moment he expected there to be no floor beneath his feet, and so the life of his whole tribe would end. Yet, the floor remained, and so too did the pain. Onwards he pushed, gasping for what little air survived in this space, finding each breath more laboured than the last. He could not see a single thing, but the stench by now was so great that he could barely restrain the vomit.",
            "The Rotting Stone must be near.",
            "Then, as if a curtain fell, it stood ahead of him. Not tall, not noble, but twisted and faintly glowing through the shadows, a current of organic essence could be seen pulsing through its core. The smell was too much even for rocks to come close, as they rolled away in an endless fight against gravity to escape their abominable brother.",
            "Above, those things - the shrieking mad things - dimly illuminated by the stone, dark clouds filled with staring, harsh, unlidded eyes, ever staring into Ruffin’s small mind, trying to extract some intelligence with which to tear and twist his thoughts. But Ruffin was not an intelligent creature. He was immune to madness. The dorfs were an immensely dim group of creatures, but they could never really amount to anything beyond crawling or rolling through the earth. And this simplicity had proven to be their saviour.",
            "His breaths fell short now, with each gasp taking in less air and more stench. With his final efforts, Ruffin mustered what little mental power a dorf may have, and mumbled a few grunts that could perhaps be considered dialogue.",
            "With that spark, that miniscule hint of intelligence, the creatures above had found their prey. They descended, swallowing Ruffin in a cloud of pure darkness, with all eyes now facing inwards, gazing with such intensity that even Ruffin understood he was in quite a bad situation. But, his simplicity shielded him from their full effect. The swirling storm of shadows had provided a barrier against the stench, with their cyclone sucking in any available air, so that once again Ruffin could breathe freely.",
            "Through the circling madness, Ruffin heard it, a command from the stone, beckoning him to come forward, to touch it. He had not the sense to argue, and so he stumbled ahead through the storm, pulling them with him, as they feasted on that speck of sentience, unaware of their surroundings.",
            "The stone hungered, and Ruffin fell forwards onto it. He felt its surface was warm, pulsing with organic currents. As he sank into the surface, blisters grew, bursting into flowers that withered just as quickly, while his flesh fused into the stone. Shrieks shot out, as the shadows now realised their situation and struggled to pull away from Ruffin’s mind, but it being so utterly dim, they could not find a path through which to excuse their existence.",
            "And so, Ruffin became entirely consumed by the stone, dragging those maddening shadows into its core with him, freeing it from their horrible cries for a while, and so it reeled back the spread of its stench, allowing Ruffin’s tribe to breathe freely once again, leaving the Dwarvs to question how such a dim creature could fight off monsters they could not survive."

        "content": [
            "Many millenia spent scraping away beneath the mountain after the Great Sealing, has drastically altered the form of the denizens of the under-spaces.",
            "The lack of natural light, clear and free air and little space to rise vertically has resulted in almost all types of folk beneath the mountain to be notably paler in skin tone, but perhaps more drastic is the mutation of breathing faculties they have developed.",
            "- Dwarvs & Dwarfs -",
            "The Dwarvs and Dwarfs both feature highly enlarged lungs and torso chambers to house them, with reduced length limbs to both reduce the amount of oxygen used, as well as to allow more free movement through cramped tunnels and caves.",
            "Beyond normal lung use, the Dwarvs and Dwarfs have a much slower metabolism than normal creatures, allowing them to inhale and store air for extended periods of time, rather than the usual breathe in - breathe out tempo.",
            "In addition to this, to further conserve oxygen, Dwarvs and Dwarfs typically move very slowly and are reluctant to do anything if not entirely necessary.",
            "Dwarvs in particular are noted to have generally larger brains than Dwarfs, although other body parts like the eyes and ears have shrunken somewhat to reduce excess energy expenditure, while the Dwarfs generally seem to have favoured larger eyes and ears in exchange for reduced brain size. This may be from lack of use, or be the cause of their current situation as the ‘workhorse’ of the mountain. Their marginally shorter stature, lack of deep mental capacity but increased sight and hearing ability make them suitable for manual labour in the mines. While typically, the Dwarvs act as their superiors who organise activities and arrange the tasks within the mines.",
            "Due to their diminished visual capacity, Dwarvs seeking to retain or improve sight ability often don spectacles polished from crystals dug from the walls, allowing them to see more clearly. However there is a common belief that these deep rooted crystals bring curses with them, and it is noted quite evidently that Dwarvs with both brain and sight, often lose them both over time.",
            "Physically, the Dwarvs and Dwarfs are both stocky and robust creatures, with Dwarvs typically standing at around 140cm, and Dwarfs at 130cm. They both have large hands  and feet with short, thick fingers and toes that allow them to tear through lighter rocks and shovel through loose ground, however they often lack dexterity and fine abilities due to the shortness and thickness of these digits. So, Dwarvs often design tools which extend and narrow the tips of their fingers, allowing much more detailed work to be performed. For Dwarfs however, simply splitting and shovelling rocks is sufficient for their everyday activities.",
            "Both groups feature two eyes (with the Dwarf eyes being larger and more able), a nose and a mouth as most top dwellers have. However the nose is universally flat and broad, with large nostrils and mouths to allow greater air consumption.",
            "To combat this difficulty with air, the Dwarvs - with the assistance of the Skarn - have discovered types of fungus under the mountain which when under duress, will release oxygen in attempts to appease their attacker. And so, devices have been built in which fungus is grown and periodically provoked, held within a storage area (typically a back mounted cylinder) where that oxygen will be freely pumped into a mouthpiece for the user to inhale. Smaller devices have also been crafted by Dwarvs, where fungus are simply dropped into a container at the end of a pipe, and then the fungus is provoked (usually by flame or physical provocation), upon which the oxygen is released and sucked down the pipe into the user's mouth. This is typically seen as a luxury device to suggest one has free control over breathing air, but it is not uncommon for various other types of fungus to be added to the pipe, allowing for various effects upon the user.",
            "It is common procedure - often expected - that whenever a Dwarv is to be seen by Dwarfs, for him or her to inhale as much air as they can, to serve two purposes. First, the increased air held within the lungs will inflate the size of that Dwarvs chest area, visibly suggesting that this Dwarv has a superior ability in regards to air consumption. Secondly, by consuming as much air as possible for him or herself, the Dwarv consequently reduces the available air for those Dwarfs around him or her, reducing their capacity for work and often forces them to assume the slow-consumption a lack of air requires, which reduces their abilities to act in any real way with speed.",
            "- Dorfs -",
            "While the Dwarvs and Dwarfs are closely related, with slight differences, the Dorfs appear markedly different from either, despite their proposed shared origins.",
            "Dorfs are shorter than the Dwarf, with a highest recorded height of 104cm, more often closer to 90cm.",
            "They retain the large chest cavities of the Dwarvs and Dwarfs, but do not possess the same robust, large lung capacity, forcing them to gasp frequently in a non regular, broken tempo. For forced evolutionary adaptation, the Dorfs have developed very hollow, brittle bones that break very easily, often under the weight of their own bodies, often leading to Dorfs who roll around rather than walk.",
            "In further efforts to improve oxygen efficiency, Dorfs of course have drastically reduced mental capacity, little better than that of a stone slug, with reduced vision - although the actual eye size has yet to catch up to the ability, possibly lingering traits from a previous branch - and almost deaf ears. They have the same slow metabolism of the other species, and require very little food to sustain existence.",
            "Overall, the Dorf is quite a poor example of life under the mountain. They are unintelligent, weak and brittle creatures with little purpose beyond filling spaces. However, given their largely hollow structure, they are often able to float indefinitely in water, and sometimes on strong air currents, making them useful for travelling across water or sending messages. Some attempts have been made at forming large air vessels by binding together many Dorfs, but it is always the case that their combined weight becomes more than they themselves can sustain, leading to their structural collapse and loss of purpose.",

            "Initially, as many of you will know, the first Skarn party to step foot through those (at the time) open gates very quickly learnt of the immense body of interest held within the mountain.",
            "Illuminated by daylight shining through the opening, the great entrance hall was surely clearly apparent. It must have been quite majestic to be able to see in sunlight (If I understand the idea of sunlight correctly) the whole thing in its intended grandeur and to truly appreciate the sheer scale of it (to say nothing of the ornate craftsmanship and architecture spanning its entire size).",
            "As they ventured deeper inside, behind them towered the by now legendary Twin Golems, likely dormant as the party were freely encouraged to continue their exploration.",
            "We have determined from the positions of many surviving artifacts which they carried on their persons at their time, they managed to make their way approximately halfway across the main entrance hall (around half a day's journey, by our calculations), through the many gargantuan support pillars and giant cauldrons we still see there today. It seems that at the time of their journey they continued entirely undisturbed, as no signs of skirmish nor trouble were discovered after the fact.",
            "It is assumed, since the remains exist, the second group were able to enter freely enough, before the major events of the First Sealing took place.",
            "Based on grooves etched into the stone floor below them, it is thought that the two Golems at this point became active (presumably signalling the gates each of them are thought to maintain to close). We still have no real clue as to the exact mechanisms working behind those gates, as we can not fathom anything within our known capabilities to shift such gargantuan pieces of solid rock.",
            "From here, we are unclear as to - what - exactly happened, except that from the two parties, only 22 survivors escaped, making their way across the remaining half of the hall and huddling in the tunnel entrances while the gates closed behind them, gradually reducing the light entering, until sheer darkness must have been the only thing remaining, much as it is now.",
            "Those 22 survivors, as is known well enough, steadily ventured deeper into the mountain network to eventually establish the Skarn settlement and cautiously expand and interact with other mountain dwellers, although as we know; not all were as accepting as the Dwarvs or Dwarfs.",
            "The Dwarvs have long informed us of the grandness of the Elder Dwargs - who, according to them, carved this entire mountain interior by their own hands and could command the Golems with a mere whisper through the rocks. Although, since we have seen no real proof consistent with these claims, we have to wonder what hand the Mountain Moles and other possible creatures may have had in the whole ordeal."

        "content": [
            "As possibly the oldest form of life under the mountain, Fungus forms a crucial part of almost every corner occupied.",
            "There are a great many known species of fungus, with probably many many more unknown species too. But to the assistance of life under the mountain, only a few need to be known about.",
            "1. Breathfungus (Aerocapsum)",
            "This is likely the most important type of fungus, as it is the most valuable to the continuation of life, since it allows enhanced levels of oxygen to exist in these dim, air-poor caves and tunnels through the intake of carbon dioxide and many other foul gases, and the subsequent release of oxygen, either voluntarily or provoked.",
            "Originally, Breathfungus was only found in the more cramped cave and tunnel systems, where the specific makeup of rocks and sediment provided a rich air for the fungus to thrive. Unfortunately, this made life for other organisms more troublesome, leading to civilisations either forming around those fungal regions, or demanding excursions to retrieve air extracted from the fungi in these regions.",
            "Then, in the late-period, the Skarn arrived, and on learning about this special fungus from Dwarven boasts, it was eventually found that the fungus could carefully be extracted wholly, and then transported to special areas in the more populated regions, which permitted the fungus to flourish, allowing the first cultivation of Breathfungus to begin, which ultimately lead to a great boom in the ability of all groups able to utilise this new technology to build large, stable civilisations beyond the nomadic dregs they had existed as for centuries prior.",
            "The Dwarvs, being familiar enough with the cave system, were able to quickly map out and take hold of those regions identified as suitable for Breathfungus growth, giving them the large monopoly on the production of breathable air we all see today.",
            "The Skarn were able to build a mutual trade with the Dwarvs, gaining more or less steady supply of air in exchange for the knowledge that the Skarn brimmed with, allowing the Dwarv kingdom to blossom into the dominant faction.",
            "The Dwarfs - naturally - were heavily taxed for access to that air, being unable to obtain it legally unless providing some form of payment grossly outweighing the normal value of air, typically lifetime servitude in one of the many new minds the Dwarfs had began work on thanks to the Skarn wisdom.",
            "Dorfs are not considered able to even request access, and so do not factor into the trade system.",
            "Most other factions are very rare to interact openly with the Dwarvs, so trade of Breathfungus air between them is almost never seen (except for the one incident of the curious Blind Goblin scout, but that is a story in itself). However, it is quite common for small raids and theft to take place on the Breathfungus farms, although it is usually raw Breathfungus that is stolen, and from what is known, none of the other groups have access to the technology to properly process Breathfungus into storable air, so it is assumed these are without real cause or effect.",
            "The fungus is quite pleasant in appearance, being a very pale blue colour, giving off a very faint luminance, allowing it to be spotted even in the dark. The body has the shape of a tall cylinder, with fine roots that are easily damaged and a fleshy mouth at the tip, which becomes the spout through which the air is released.",
            "It is important to note that if you do encounter one of these fungi in the wild, do not disturb it, as even slight impacts have been documented to upset the roots and easily destroy the organism, ruining its potential for air harvesting. Instead, report its location (ideally to the Skarn) as it is possible that unknown Breathfungus colonies still exist, and should be quickly made note of.",
            "2. Rotfungus (Putrimyces) ! EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS !",
            "Very little needs to be said about the dangers of this Rotfungus, sitting in almost stark opposition to the Breathfungus in what it brings to our lives.",
            "Due to the hazardous nature of Rotfungus, deep study of its exact nature has been almost impossible, limited only to distant observations and even more distant observations of its effects.",
            "The Rotfungus is a highly volatile fungus (well, we assume it is a fungus), known to enter silently and then within days proliferate to overwhelm entire villages with its dreadful spread.",
            "We are unsure as to how it is able to simply enter an area, with speculations that it is more of a virus spread by some small creatures crawling perhaps within the rocks, as it is almost always reported as initially sprouting from small crevices in the faces of rocks.",
            "Much like the Breathfungus releases breathable air, the Rotfungus releases its own substance, made visible by small, floating spores that each seem to give off smaller particles, which in turn fall onto surfaces and quickly develop into new sites of growth, which repeat the cycle.",
            "This substance; the gas - or perhaps tiny particles - that infiltrate the air between spores and their bodies, seems to be some form of rapid rot inducing material, which upon encountering ANY material begins the spread of the blistering, frothing rot which quickly overtakes the entire surface of that material and any others nearby.",
            "Given this highly toxic nature, immediate observation of its effects has been impossible, usually only recounted by fleeing parties, and the occasional luckily timed Skarn investigation unit able to observe its effects from a distance.",
            "Records thus far state that the rot spreads quickly, most terribly on consuming organic subjects, seeming to be enticed by their screams to more quickly overwhelm them. The flesh first blisters, growing into large sacs of fluid that proceed to burst as if the flesh itself was boiling,  until the entire layer of flesh and muscle has been boiled away, leaving the bones held together by what connective tissue remains, before they too become consumed, often being overtaken before they have time to fall to the ground. It is an interesting display to see an entire being vanish into the air in such a short time. Some of the more curious Skarn have pondered the utility of being able to contain and weaponise this substance, but of course no official progress has been made (or attempted, I have to say) towards this.",
            "The fungus itself is quite unassuming, being a fleshy, pale brown capped body, with spreading tendril-like roots extending from the stem down through whichever surface it has infiltrated. The size is typically small, no more than the size of a fist, although tales have surfaced of enormous fungi in deeper, unexplored regions (obviously, unsubstantiated).",
            "3. Dreamfungus (Hallucapsum)",
            "The Dreamfungus seems to be a more or less harmless family of fungus, although many terrible things have certainly stemmed from its use.",
            "There are many different varieties of Dreamfungus, with varying levels of effect on interaction, but they all seem to eventually induce some hypnotic effect through prolonged exposure, or more severely through consumption.",
            "The fungus will consistently release a steady, unseen cloud of its own tiny spores, which linger within a metre of the fungal body, making its effect fairly minimal to passers by.",
            "It is believed that the Dreamfungus actually is a toxic strain, but that the fungus is so old, that its toxicity was tailored to now dead creatures, with the current cave inhabitants being immune to any direct death-incurring effects.",
            "Because of this relative safety, and the clear positive production of the Breathfungus, it seems natural that the cave inhabitants have attempted to exploit some positive value from the Dreamfungus.",
            "As a consequence, it was quickly discovered that while no immediate effects were seen on exposure to the Dreamfungus, many who spent too long in close proximity to colonies of Dreamfungus began to hallucinate and fall into trance like slumbers; which they were unable to wake from voluntarily, only recovering if pulled away by other parties.",
            "Given such an effect, it is normal on finding colonies of Dreamfungus, to find various bodies in states of life and death, making these colonies of high interest to thieves and curious researchers in search of subjects.",
            "While this slow-sleep is one known effect of the fungus, another more immediate response can be seen on consumption.",
            "It is common amongst the Dwarfs (and some Dwarvs) to both inhale or eat the Dreamfungus.",
            "With Dwarfs it is typical to have small pouches at their waists containing cut pieces, left to ooze and release their gases slowly to be inhaled in higher concentrations on opening and breathing in from the pouch.",
            "Dwarvs however, seem to find this practice dirty and uncivilised, opting instead to place more finely cut pieces of the Dreamfungus into the ends of their ostentatious pipes, usually used simply for displaying air-superiority.",
            "Some Dwarvs will simply cold-inhale from these pieces, which instigates a similar intoxicating, waking sleep to the Dwarf bag method, which has been reported as a generally pleasant sensation, often used to relax the user, or to allow more comfortable sleep to be passed into. Whereas other, more adventurous Dwarvs have started to provoke the Dreamfungus in the same way as Breathfungus, bringing flame to the fungal flesh.",
            "This produces a rapid release of a slightly different gas, much more potent than the passive release of the previous methods, with a smell that has been noted as faintly similar to the Rotfungus release.",
            "The intoxication from this is much more severe, inducing a rapid temporary coma, which usually sees the user (if not seated) collapsing to the floor in a twitching mess, frothing at the mouth and uttering unknown words that seem to be without logic or structure. The user will usually wake from this state after a day or two, but the more interesting nature of this is the visions that the users almost universally report experiencing, saying that from their own perspectives, they were speaking loudly to tall, semi-transleucent spectres, that seemed not only sapient, but moving through the mountain in ways that seem to suggest an entire civilisation.",
            "With one or two random cases, it would probably be ignored as the ramblings of a hallucinating fool. But these cases are almost always reported whenever a user is questioned after the fact, leading to much discussion and suggestions of more focused research into the exact nature of this product of the Dreamfungus.",
            "The Dreamfungus visually is quite prominent, with a large white cap, adorned with a variety of colored spots according to its exact species. Variations of effect across different strains have not been noted, with most users simply describing different tastes from each."
