# Cathedral Of Rot Site

This repository contains the structured JSON content behind **The Cathedral of Rot** — a subterranean fantasy world of fungal kingdoms, fractured castes, and whispered madness beneath the stone.

All entries, quotes, characters, and settings are part of an original, evolving fictional universe developed by **Alexander Gorham**.

## 📜 Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A structured archive of world entries (categorized and browsable)
- A data source for the accompanying website and creative projects
- A reference for collaboration, portfolio, and creative development inquiries

## 🤝 Collaborations Welcome
