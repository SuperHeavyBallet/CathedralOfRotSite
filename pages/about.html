                    <h4>About The Cathedral of Rot</h4>
                    <p>The Cathedral of Rot is a sprawling, interconnected universe of subterranean decay, absurd philosophy, and crumbling empires. Set deep beneath the surface of a forgotten world, it is a place where language holds power, fungus breathes life, and fractured species claw meaning from the ruins of older civilizations.</p>
                    <p>At its heart, The Cathedral of Rot explores the collision of ideology, biology, and belief within an ancient mountain hollowed out by time, ambition, and rot. Through novels, stories, bestiaries, maps, and field journals, the world is slowly uncovered—not in linear order, but in fragmented testimonies, delusional chronicles, and half-remembered truths.</p>

                    <h4>The Core Narrative</h4>
                    <p>The flagship work of the universe is the novel <i>The Hollow Bleed</i>, a darkly satirical fantasy following Markus Brehn, a Skarn observer, as he journeys downward through the mountain's many layers. What begins as academic curiosity soon dissolves into horror, rebellion, and revelation as Markus encounters the complex under-societies of the mountain: the warring Dwarvs, the passive Dwarfs, the secretive Word Keepers, and the reemerging Dwarg elite.</p>

                    <p>Through his descent, Markus discovers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bizarrre fungal ecosystems with strange and sometimes semi-sentient properties.</li>
                        <li>Bureaucratic absurdity and caste conflict between biologically identical but ideologically divided peoples.</li>
                        <li>A metaphysical force known as The First Word, capable of shaping reality through precise language.</li>
                        <li>Ancient ruins left by a vanished race known only as The Elders, whose collapse may have unbalanced the world itself.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Key Themes:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decay and Power – Institutions rot, but cling to form. Language ossifies. Authority is often absurd but still dangerous.</li>
                        <li>Fungus and Thought – Fungal life is not mere background; it infects, enlightens, and connects. Air, dream, and rotfungus form the biological and spiritual spine of the world.</li>
                        <li>Fragmented Reality – Truth is subjective, biased by memory, word, and translation. Many texts within the Cathedral contradict one another.</li>
                        <li>Satirical Horror – Bureaucracies that suffocate, religious orders that lose the point, ideologies that loop back into madness—all presented with biting dark humor.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Dwarg Lineage:</h4>
                    <p>At the center of the mountain's socio-political history lies the fragmented lineage of the Dwargs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dwargs: The original subterranean species, gifted with language, split by ideology.</li>
                        <li>Foolish, power-hungry descendants who claim superiority through ‘education’.</li>
                        <li>Dwarfs: Peaceful, practical folk who simply exist within the mountain.</li>
                        <li>Word Keepers: Isolated, monastic Dwargs devoted to cataloging and ‘perfecting’ language itself.</li>
                        <li>The Returned Dwargs: A hidden technocratic faction, reemerging with dreams of absolute order through intellectual domination.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These factions, alongside the Skarn and countless mutated, fungal, and forgotten beings, create a deep tangle of allegiances, myths, and revolutions beneath the stone.</p>

                    <p>The Cathedral of Rot is not a single story—it is a decaying archive. A mountain of conflicting voices. A slow infection. A growing body of fiction that expands downward, not outward.</p>

                    <p>You are invited to descend.</p>

                <h4>My Inspirations</h4>
                <p> Ever since the mid 90's, I have been enthralled by the dark, gritty, gothic and often hillariously horrible worlds that human minds have so meticulously conjured.</p>
