                <h4>Fragments Bled from The Hollow</h4>
                <p>A Lore Compendium support piece</p>
                <p>This will be a collection of text and images, serving as a background description of just what is going on beneath the mountain. Through found notes, short narratives, observations, academic descriptions and maps, the reader will gain a greater understanding of the mechanics and dynamics that all exist so heavily intertweened beneath the rocks.</p>

                <h4>The Hollow Bleed</h4>
                <p>The initial primary novel set in this Universe</p>
                <p>This novel will follow Markus Brehn, a Skarn Chronicler who wishes to expand and learn more about the world beneath his feet.</p>
                <p>This story involves many characters from many of the races and groups described in the archives, and sees Markus venturing from the highest recluses within the mountain, to the deepest rivers flowing through its heart.</p>

            <h4>Short Story Collection</h4>
                <p>In addition to The Hollow Bleed, I would like to publish a collection of shorter stories set within the same universe to explore alternative narratives, adventures and mysteries undoubtedly found buried away.</p>

                <h4>Patreon for Ultra Fans</h4>
                    <p>I am considering starting a Patreon for fans of this universe, allowing exclusive access to unpublished materials and early insight into the goings on in the world.</p>
